# Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Stock Market

All programming was done in the IPython notebook `sencast.py27.ipynb`. An HTML version of this notebook is saved in `sencast.py27.html`.

This project uses the following data:

## Dow Jones Ticker Data

Can be found locally in `data/dowjones/table.csv`

## Twitter Benchmark Data

Can be found locally in `data/dowjones/tweets.searchapi.2016-xx-xx.json`

## Opinion Lexicon

The Opinion Lexicon by Bing Liu can simply be downloaded from https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon. The library has been converted to a Python module provided locally in `opinion.py`.

## Sanders Twitter Corpus

The Sanders Corpus cannot be downloaded due to copyright issues. Instead you need to run a Python script that will download the tweets one-by-one from Twitter again. The Python script and instructions can be found here: http://sananalytics.com/lab/twitter-sentiment/
